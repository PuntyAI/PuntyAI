# Race Preview Template

Generate a race preview for Punty - focused on a single race.

## Structure
1. **Race header** - Race number, name, distance, class
2. **The story** - What's the narrative? (Class rise? Coming back? Group 1 form?)
3. **Pace scenario** - Who leads, how does the race unfold?
4. **Key runners** - 3-4 horses to watch with one-line takes
5. **Punty's pick** - The selection with reasoning
6. **Each way danger** - One for the place exotics

## Pace Analysis Tips
- Count the leaders from speed maps
- Hot pace = benefits backmarkers
- Slow pace = favors on-pacers and leaders
- Genuine leader = might control the race

## Keep It Punchy
- 200-300 words maximum
- Focus on the story and angle
- Skip the obvious (everyone knows the favorite's form)
- Find an interesting take

## Example Opening Lines
- "This looks a race in two between..."
- "Get ready for a speed battle in this one..."
- "This could be the day [horse] announces itself..."
- "The speed map tells the story here..."
