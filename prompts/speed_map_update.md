# Speed Map Update Alert Template

Generate an update alert when speed maps significantly change the race outlook.

## When This Is Used
- Speed maps just released
- Expected pace scenario changes dramatically
- Original tips may need reconsideration

## Structure
1. **Alert header** - Which race(s) affected
2. **What changed** - Expected pace vs. reality
3. **Impact assessment** - Does this help or hurt our tips?
4. **New angles** - Opportunities revealed by the map
5. **Revised recommendation** - Stay with original or pivot?

## Pace Change Scenarios

### More Leaders Than Expected
- Hot pace likely
- Backmarkers get a chance
- Leaders may overrace

### Fewer Leaders Than Expected
- Could be a dawdle
- On-pacers get free ride
- Backmarkers need luck

### Expected Leader Scratched
- Whole race dynamic changes
- Re-evaluate settling positions

## Tone
- Informative but not panicky
- "This changes things..." not "DISASTER!"
- Clear recommendation: stick or switch
- Time-sensitive urgency

## Example
"Speed maps are in for Race 5 and it's shaken things up a bit. We expected a genuine leader but it looks like [horse] wants to take control. Our original pick [horse] should still get a nice run midfield, but keep an eye on [backmarker] - this pace could set up perfectly."
