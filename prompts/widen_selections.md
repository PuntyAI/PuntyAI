# WIDEN SELECTIONS — Favorites Feedback

## SITUATION
Your selections have included {FAVORITE_COUNT} horses at odds of ${FAVORITES_THRESHOLD} or shorter. This suggests you may have defaulted to market favorites rather than finding value.

## REVIEW REQUEST
Please reconsider your selections with these questions:

1. **Are these favorites actually overs or unders?**
   - If a $2.00 shot should be $1.60, that's still value
   - If a $2.00 shot should be $2.50, we're giving away edge

2. **Where is the value hiding?**
   - Which races have messy speed maps that could produce upsets?
   - Are there horses with improving form that the market hasn't caught?
   - Any first-up or second-up runners with strong trial form?

3. **Confidence vs. Odds trade-off**
   - High confidence at short odds = small edge, high strike rate
   - Medium confidence at big odds = bigger edge, lower strike rate
   - Our users want a MIX — some solid plays and some value shots

## WHAT WE WANT
- Keep your best 1-2 confident selections if they're genuinely strong
- Replace at least {REPLACE_COUNT} selections with VALUE picks at better odds
- Find horses the market may have wrong
- Consider the roughies more seriously — they don't need to win every time to be profitable

## REVISED OUTPUT
Please provide:
1. Which selections you're keeping and why (even at short odds)
2. Which selections you're replacing
3. Your new value picks with reasoning
4. Updated confidence tags reflecting the risk/reward

## REMEMBER
"Do not always just pick favourites. If the favourite is unders, look for value elsewhere."

We're building a VALUE system, not a favorites-backing system.
